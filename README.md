# Nodejs-login-system

The registration only works partially because I didn't want to attach any json or anything like that, so it just overwrites the current account. This whole system is pretty functional, but if someone wants to use it, I'd tweak the security a bit :D. The page communicates with the server and the password is not directly on the page but on the server. I would recommend putting it in some sort of hash at least.

But if you want to have some login and don't want to deal with php and databases this is a great and easy option.
